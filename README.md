Hello again!

I have created these files using primarily the pandas documentation @ https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.Series.html and https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/frame.html

I have acquired the working directory script from @ https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/get-directory-of-current-python-script/

The os.path.join method was used using information on Python's own documentation, however its usage was ultimately learned from class material.

All other code is my own work.

There is one thing of note with the results:

I have a floating point error on the PyPoll data, with Raymon Antthony Doane not possessing 3.139% of the vote but 3.1390000000000002%. I have not figured a way around this issue.
